# README GENERATOR

  ## Description
  
  My motivation to build this project was to learn how to use back end technologies just as  node, npm, and inquirer to create an app that builds professional README files to all the developers that want one to describe their projects..
  
  The reason to build this project is because i know how important is to have a professional README file.
  
  Talking about the problem that this project solve is that usually developers do not have a guide of how to build a great README file so with this app the user is ab.
  
  The main lesson of this project was how to use inquirer in js, an also how to export and import files from one javascript to another javascript file, also to use inquirer .
